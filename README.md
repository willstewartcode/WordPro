# WordPro
A recreation of "Wordle" for Android.

This game plays similar to Wordle. The user is tasked with guessing each letter in a five letter word, and has six total attempts to guess all five letters of the word correctly. For each attempt, five individual letters must be entered by the user, which are then checked against a random five letter word pulled from a list of words. If a guessed letter is found in the random word, its background will change to yellow. If that guessed letter is found in the random word and is in the correct position, its background will change to green. Once an attempt is checked, the game will automatically move on to the next attempt, until six attempts have been completed.

Credit for app concept goes to <b>Josh Wardle</b>, the developer of the original Wordle web game.
